We provide a summary of the original Rejectron algorithm for PQ learning~\citep{pqlearn} as it is the primary motivation for our work.
Rejectron (\autoref{alg:rejectron}) takes as input a labeled training set of $n$ samples $\mathbf{x}$ (iid over $\mathcal{P}$), an unlabeled test set of $n$ samples $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ (iid over $\mathcal{Q}$), an error $\epsilon$ and a weight $\Lambda$.
The output is a selective classifier, that predicts according to a base classifier $h$ if the input $x$ is inside some set $S$ and otherwise rejects (abstains from predicting).
\begin{equation}
    \left. h\right|_{S}(x) \coloneqq \begin{cases}
                                         h(x) & x\in S \\
                                         \text{reject} & x\not\in S
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:selective_classifier}
\end{equation}
Under several assumptions and a special value $\epsilon^\star$, this selective classifier is guaranteed with high probability to have error less then $2 \epsilon^\star$ on $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$
and a rejection rate below $\epsilon^\star$ on ${\mathbf{x}}$ (see Theorem 5.7 in~\citeauthor{pqlearn}).

        2. Choose $c_{t} \in C$ to maximize $s_{t}(c)\coloneqq\operatorname{err}_{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}}\left(\left.h\right|_{S_{t}}, c\right)-\Lambda \cdot \operatorname{err}_{\mathbf{x}}(h, c)$ over $c \in C$\\
        3. If $s_{t}\left(c_{t}\right) \leq \epsilon$, then stop and return $\left.h\right|_{S_{t}}$
    }
\end{algorithm}
Rejectron starts by querying an empirical risk minimization (ERM) oracle that uses a 0--1 risk score over a concept class $C$ for a model $h$ that perfectly learns the training dataset.
A primary assumption for Rejectron to output a perfect model as well as for it to eventually find a selective classifier that meets the $\epsilon^\star$ bound is that the true decision function
(i.e., the function that creates the training labels) is also a member of $C$.
The authors refer to this setting as \textit{realizable}.

On the first iteration of the algorithm, Rejectron finds another model $c_1\in C$ that jointly maximizes the error with respect to $h$ on $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ while minimizing it on ${\mathbf{x}}$.
The authors show that they can efficiently solve this optimization problem using a single ERM query on a dataset of $n^2+n$ samples (see Lemma 5.1 in~\citeauthor{pqlearn}).

In every subsequent step $t>1$ a set $S_t$ is created where all models $h$ through to $c_{t-1}$ agree.
Another model $c_t\in C$ is found that maximizes the same objective as above but only on the intersection of $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ and $S_t$.
Upon termination a selective classifier $\left. h\right|_{S_t}$ is output.
